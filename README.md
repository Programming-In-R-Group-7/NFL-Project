#We can try out github to see if it works easier than uploading to ICON
I did some cleaning and am working on making a column for over/ under hit but am running into some problems
if there is missing data for over/ under line then the code just stops running, my next step was to just delete the rows
that don't have complete betting data to see if it will run all the way through.  Let me know if you guys have any ideas.#
